            <p> So, Iâ€™ve been thinking... and I just gotta say itâ€” <strong>I like you, girl ðŸ˜‰</strong>.
            <p>
                So, I like you, girlâ€”your drawing, your face, and especially your eyes. 
                You're my type of girl. I know it hasnâ€™t been that long since we got to know each other, 
                and yeah, I always joke about seeing you 22 times at school beforeâ€”but it's true.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we've met face-to-face, I like you even moreâ€”especially your voice, 
                since I hadnâ€™t heard it before. And, I gotta be honest... I really have a huge crush on you, girl. ðŸ˜‰
